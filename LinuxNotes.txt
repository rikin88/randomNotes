Linux notes:

df -h //show mounted drives
lsblk //show all attached drives (even if not mounted)
sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media/mydir //mount directory to specific partition
free -h // show mem usage in gbs

ip route show
ip addr show
netstat -i, -r(route)

host google.com (show ip addr of google)
cat /etc/resolv.conf - dns info

ps aux //list all processes
/etc/passwd 
id r380928 (group info)
who (check whos logged in)
last
sudo useradd -m rikin
cd /home/rikin
ls -a (includes hidden files!)
ls -lS (sort by file size desc)
ls -d */ (list out only the directories)
cd /etc/skel    ls -a
sudo passwd rikin (then enter passwd)

cat command:

cat -b list1.txt (show line numbers but not on blank lines)
cat -n list1.txt (show line numbers for all lines)
cat -s list1.txt (squeeze linebreaks to just 1 line break) - doesnt change contents of file
cat -E list1.txt (shows end of line w/ $ sign)
cat > test.txt ( copy contents to test.txt)
cat >> test.txt (append to file)
cat list1.txt list2.txt > out.txt (added contents of two files into one)


mkdir command

mkdir -p names/mark (create dir structure w/ -p param to force dir creation)
mkdir -p names/{john,tom,bob}  //create multiple sub directories (no spaces!)

mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e
rmdir -pv a/b/c/d/e (v for verbose)
ls -R (show all directories)
rm -rv a/b (removes directories even w/ files, r = recursive)

cp command

cp file1.txt file2.txt
cp -i file1.txt //i for interactive (overwrite?)
cp ../file1.txt ../file2.txt . (copy 2 files from one dir above into curr dir)
cp -R dir1 dir3 (copy dir from one to another, have to use -R Recursive flag)

mv command

mv file1.txt file2.txt //src target
mv file3.txt dir1/
ls dir1/
mv -i file3.txt dir1 (-i interactive for overwrite)
mv dir1 dir2
mv dir2 dir3 (where dir3  doesnt exsist) - then it copies contents of dir into dir3 (will not move dir2 inside dir3)
//if dir3 already exists then it will create dir2 inside dir3
mv -v file3.txt dir3 (verbose)


less command

less big.txt
space to jump pages
up and down arrows to go scroll up /down
B - one page up at a time
G - shift+G - go to end of file
1G or g - go to top of file
/book - search for book occurences in file
click n for next occurence
?book to search from down to up (n for next)
q to quite less command


touch file1 (updates timestamp of file if file already exists, if not creates a new file)

nano file.txt (creates a new file, but have to save it first )
ctrl+o to save file


sudo = super user do
allows user to extra privs as admin or power user
ex: sudo mkdir /etc/newdir 
sudo -s //changes to root user

top command - dynamic real time view of your computer - see which processes consuming process/cpu
type s to change delay from 3 secs(default) to another number in seconds
type i filter out idle processes
top , then k to kill specific process id

kill command

killof <process name> // gets pid
kill pid
kill -KILL pid //hard kill
kill -9 pid //hard kill
ps -ux //gets all processes for current user ..use -aux for all users
ps -U <username> //gets all processes for specific user name
ps -C <processname> //gets you all instances of process

file permissions

when you do ls -l you see:

-rw-rw-r--
type of file - directory, binary, character, normal file(-)
next 3: owner of file
next 3: group of file
next 3: everyone else
then symbolic link
then name of owner of file
then name of group of file
filesize
date when created
filename

chmod command
chmod o+x //add executable permission to others category
chmod o+w // add write position
chmod g+x // add exe for group
chmod g-wx //remove write and exe for group
chmod ug=rwx // set permissions for user and group of file to rwx
chmod ugo-rwx //removes all permissions from everyone
chmod a-rwx // a = all
chmod u+rw,g=rw,o+r //another way to give multiple categories permissions
//these are called symbolic notations

chmod using octal number notation
chmod 000 file.txt
chmod 777 file.txt

which bash //tells you where bash location is

scripting:

#!/bin/bash  //hashBang - always first line of script
to execute script (needs execute permission):

which ls //returns location where ls command is located
whatis ls //gives a short description of what the command does (also can see from man ls)
whatis grep
whatis cat

//-c comments for user
create user w/ root access level
sudo password mark //provide a new password for newly created user 

userdel command

sudo userdel mark //doesn't delete folder from home dir
sudo userdel -r mark //deletes folder as well

groups:

groups //checks which group user is in
cat /etc/group

sudo groupadd Java //adding a new group
sudo groupdel Java //deleting a group
sudo gpasswd -a rikin Java //adding user to a specific group  -d for deleting user from group
sudo gpasswd -d rikin Java //deleting user from a specific group

.bashrc //file used to set up initial script when terminal window opens
ex: add alias ls='ls -l' //anytime you type ls , it will type in long list format

df command  //avail diskspace on filesystem
df -h //makes it human readable
du -h //tells you how much memory is used w/in a specific directory
du -sh //gives you only the summary and not details regarding each file
free //gives u used and free and cached space used by kernel
free -h //human readable ..-m megabytes -g gigabytes

watch free -h //repeatedly execute specific command
watch -n 1 free -m
watch -n 0,5 free -m

head 10 wifi.log
tail 10 wifi.log
tail -f wifi.log
head wifi.log install.log

find command

find /home/rikin -name test.html //find test.html in specifed dir
find /home -name *.txt //find using wildcard
find / -name wifi.log //will need to use sudo here due to permission denied exception
find /home/rikin -mtime -2 //give me files from 2 day ago till now
